# Instructions for Claude

## Git Commit Rules

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT commit and push changes unless explicitly requested by the user.

Only commit and push when the user says one of the following:
- "Commit and push"
- "Push this"
- "Commit these changes"
- Or similar explicit requests

This helps maintain control over what gets pushed to the repository and when.
