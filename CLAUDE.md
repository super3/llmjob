# Instructions for Claude

## Testing Requirements

Always run tests before starting work and after completing tasks. A task is NOT complete unless all tests pass. Use `npm test` in the appropriate directory to verify code quality and functionality.

## Git Commit Rules

Never commit or push changes unless explicitly requested (e.g., "Push"). This maintains control over what gets pushed to the repository.
