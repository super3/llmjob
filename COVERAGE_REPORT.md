- **Branches**: 74.81% (395/528)
- **Functions**: 82.19% (240/292)
- **Lines**: 85.82% (981/1143)

### Coverage by Module

| Module | Coverage | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Middleware** | 100% | ✅ Complete |
| **Controllers** | 98.51% | ✅ Near Complete |
| **Repositories** | 91.5% | ✅ High Coverage |

| **Utils** | 84.78% | ✅ Good Coverage |
| **Routes** | 78.94% | ⚠️ Moderate |

## Work Completed

### 1. Fixed Test Infrastructure
- Resolved timeout issues in async tests
- Fixed Redis compatibility between redis-mock and Redis v5
- Added proper timeout values to long-running tests
- Fixed memory leak warnings by setting max listeners

### 2. Created Comprehensive Test Suites
- **complete-coverage.test.js**: Comprehensive test suite targeting all uncovered lines
- **coverage-fix.test.js**: Focused tests for specific uncovered functionality
- **final-coverage.test.js**: Final push for remaining uncovered lines

### 3. Key Improvements
- Fixed NodeRepository to handle undefined keys() and sMembers() results
- Added tests for error conditions and edge cases
- Improved BaseRepository callback compatibility testing
- Added controller error path testing

## Remaining Uncovered Areas

### Services (74.71% coverage)
- **jobServiceV2.js**: 47.36% - Complex async operations need more testing
- **nodeServiceV2.js**: 51.85% - Advanced node management features

### Minor Gaps
- Some error handling branches in JobRepository
- Callback-based operations in BaseRepository
- Advanced queue operations in services

## Recommendations

1. **Focus on Service Layer**: The service layer has the most room for improvement, particularly V2 services
2. **Integration Tests**: Consider adding integration tests for complete workflows
3. **Mock Strategy**: Review mocking strategy for redis-mock vs actual Redis clients
4. **CI/CD**: Ensure all tests pass in CI environment

## Files Modified

### Source Files
- `/server/src/repositories/NodeRepository.js` - Added null checks for keys() operations

### Test Files Created
- `/server/tests/complete-coverage.test.js`
- `/server/tests/coverage-fix.test.js`
- `/server/tests/final-coverage.test.js`

### Test Files Modified
- `/server/tests/nodeService.test.js` - Added timeouts to prevent test failures
- `/server/tests/redisCompat.test.js` - Fixed async callback handling

## Next Steps

To achieve 100% coverage:

1. **Complete JobServiceV2 Testing**
   - Test all queue management methods
   - Add tests for bulk operations
   - Cover analytics and metrics methods

2. **Complete NodeServiceV2 Testing**
   - Test node health monitoring
   - Add performance metrics tests
   - Cover cleanup operations

3. **Fix Remaining Service Gaps**
   - Lines 510-517 in jobService (timeout handling)
   - Lines 99-107 in nodeService (update errors)

4. **Address Branch Coverage**
   - Focus on untested conditional branches
   - Add tests for all error paths

## Conclusion

The test coverage has been significantly improved, with most critical components now having excellent coverage. The middleware and controllers are nearly fully tested, providing confidence in the API layer. The remaining work primarily involves testing advanced service layer features and error conditions.
