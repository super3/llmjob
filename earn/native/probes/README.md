# Kernel probes

Standalone CUDA programs that establish a card's denominators. None needs the miner.
Run these before touching the kernel: every ratio in `OPTIMIZATION.md` and the 4090
tuning log is relative to that card's ceiling, and none of them transfer between
architectures.

```
nvcc -arch=sm_120 -O3 -o mmapeak mmapeak.cu && ./mmapeak 512
```

| Probe | Answers |
|---|---|
| `mmapeak.cu` | Pure `mma.m16n8k32.s8` from registers, no memory. Hardware ceiling + power. |

## Measured

| Card | Ceiling @512 thr | Power at ceiling | Miner | % of ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RTX 4090 (sm_89) | 338 T-MAC/s | 156 W | 216.0 TH/s | 64% |
| RTX 5090 (sm_120) | **482.6 T-MAC/s** | **153 W @ 2400 MHz** | 138 TH/s | **28.6%** |

The 5090 reaches a 1.43x higher tensor ceiling on the same power as the 4090. The
shipped kernel meanwhile draws 575 W (its full cap) at 1170 MHz -- 38% of the 3090 MHz
max, with `SW Power Cap` active. Pure MMA does not do that, so the power is going to
the memory path, and the clock it costs is what puts a 5090 below a 4090.

## Traps (learned the hard way, see tuning log s6)

- **A store the compiler can prove dead deletes the whole workload.** The first version
  of `mmapeak` guarded its store with `if (threadIdx.x == 1024)`, which is never true;
  it reported 377,140 T-MAC/s in 0.00 ms. Store unconditionally.
- **Check `cudaGetLastError()` after the launch, not just after the sync.** A launch
  that fails on resources reports 0.00 ms rather than an error.
- **Check `nvidia-smi` compute processes first.** A miner or LLM sharing the card
  silently contaminates every reading.

## Power is the binding constraint on sm_120

The 5090 is hard power-capped running this kernel: steady state sits at exactly the
cap with `SW Power Cap: Active` and only 47 C, so there is no thermal headroom to
recover. Hashrate is bought with watts, almost perfectly linearly:

| power limit | TH/s | TH/s per W |
|---|---|---|
| 450 W | 117.7 | 0.262 |
| 525 W | 135.6 | 0.258 |
| 575 W | 145.4 | 0.253 |
| 600 W | 148.7 | 0.248 |

At ~0.25 TH/W, 300 TH/s would need 1200 W. **The only route to the goal is roughly
doubling MACs per joule** -- there is no clock left to find.

Where the power goes, per launch (49.08 ms, from Nsight):

| | |
|---|---|
| tensor instructions | 2,147,483,648 |
| ALU instructions | 6,305,857,536 (2.9 per MMA) |
| total instructions | 13,310,255,104 |
| L2 traffic | 104 GB -> 2.12 TB/s |
| DRAM traffic | 3.18 GB -> 65 GB/s (3.5% of peak) |
| shared loads | 412 GB -> 8.4 TB/s |

The tensor pipe is 69.41% active, essentially identical to Ada's 69.9%, and the
arithmetic closes exactly: 0.694 x 482 x (1095/2400) = 152.6 against 152.5 measured.
Nsight's percentages are per ACTIVE CYCLE, so they hide the clock -- the kernel is
issuing MMA just as densely as on the 4090 and losing purely on frequency.

Ruled out as the power sink: DRAM (3.5%), shared-memory bank conflicts (64,620 of
3.2e9 wavefronts), operand data toggling (a variant with 8 distinct operand sets
measured 156 W against 153 W for constant operands), and codegen fallbacks (sm_120
emits native LDGSTS and LDSM, and its integer op counts match sm_89).

### The memory clock experiment

Locking the memory clock exposes how the budget is split:

| memory clock | SM clock | TH/s |
|---|---|---|
| 14001 MHz | 1322 MHz | 157.9 |
| 7001 MHz | 1353 MHz | 158.4 |
| 810 MHz | **2659 MHz** | 99.7 |

At 810 MHz the SM clock DOUBLES inside the same 600 W -- the memory domain is worth
roughly half the power budget -- but hashrate collapses, because L2 is in that clock
domain and the fold pulls 2.12 TB/s through it. At 2659 MHz with bandwidth intact the
kernel would be around 368 TH/s. So **L2 traffic per MAC is the thing to attack**;
DRAM traffic is already irrelevant.

## The ablation table does not transfer from Ada

Built with `-DPEARL_ABLATE_BARRIER`, `-DPEARL_ABLATE_STAGING`, `-DPEARL_ABLATE_TRANSCRIPT`.
These produce WRONG results by construction and exist only to price each layer.

| build | 5090 | clock | 4090 (tuning log) |
|---|---|---|---|
| shipped | 155.1 | 1281 MHz | 216.0 |
| barrier deleted | 155.3 (**0%**) | | 246.7 (14.2%) |
| transcript deleted | 155.5 (1.4%) | 1274 MHz | |
| staging deleted | 203.0 (**24%**) | 1514 MHz | 242.6 (~13%) |
| staging + transcript | 206.0 | 1492 MHz | |

**The two cards have opposite bottlenecks.** On Ada the block-wide barrier was the
biggest single item at 14.2% and staging cost ~13%. On Blackwell the barrier is free
-- consistent with its 1.11 barrier-stall ratio against Ada's 2.47 -- and staging
costs 24%, nearly double. So the tuning log's "biggest identified item: the block-wide
barrier" and its proposed half-chunk pipelining do not apply here; chasing them on
this card would have been wasted work.

Note the clock column: deleting staging lifts the SM clock from 1281 to 1514 MHz
inside the same 600 W. Staging is not costing time so much as costing *power*, and
power is costing clock.

### TMA is available and works

`cp.async.bulk.shared::cluster.global` compiles for sm_120 AND executes correctly on
the 5090 (verified byte-exact, 2048/2048). Ada has no such instruction, so this is a
genuinely Blackwell-only lever: one bulk copy can replace the 3072 separate 16-byte
`cp.async` requests a block issues per chunk, along with their address arithmetic --
which is where the 6.3e9 ALU instructions (2.9 per MMA) are going.

The kernel's manual XOR swizzle (16-byte unit q of row r stored at q XOR (r mod 8))
is exactly TMA's SWIZZLE_128B pattern, so the shared layout would not have to change.

## Tile geometry is already optimal on Blackwell

The register file is 65536 per SM on sm_120, the same as Ada, so the accumulator
bound the tuning log derives holds unchanged. Measured:

| tile | regs | spill | TH/s |
|---|---|---|---|
| 128x256 (shipped) | 128 | 0 | 154.7 |
| 256x128 | 128 | 0 | 154.3 |
| 256x256 | - | 5456 B | fails |
| 128x512 | - | 1416 B | fails |

Threads per block: 256 -> 138.6, 512 -> 153.6, 1024 -> exceeds registers. 512 stays.
