# Kernel probes

Standalone CUDA programs that establish a card's denominators. None needs the miner.
Run these before touching the kernel: every ratio in `OPTIMIZATION.md` and the 4090
tuning log is relative to that card's ceiling, and none of them transfer between
architectures.

```
nvcc -arch=sm_120 -O3 -o mmapeak mmapeak.cu && ./mmapeak 512
```

| Probe | Answers |
|---|---|
| `mmapeak.cu` | Pure `mma.m16n8k32.s8` from registers, no memory. Hardware ceiling + power. |

## Measured

| Card | Ceiling @512 thr | Power at ceiling | Miner | % of ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RTX 4090 (sm_89) | 338 T-MAC/s | 156 W | 216.0 TH/s | 64% |
| RTX 5090 (sm_120) | **482.6 T-MAC/s** | **153 W @ 2400 MHz** | 138 TH/s | **28.6%** |

The 5090 reaches a 1.43x higher tensor ceiling on the same power as the 4090. The
shipped kernel meanwhile draws 575 W (its full cap) at 1170 MHz -- 38% of the 3090 MHz
max, with `SW Power Cap` active. Pure MMA does not do that, so the power is going to
the memory path, and the clock it costs is what puts a 5090 below a 4090.

## Traps (learned the hard way, see tuning log s6)

- **A store the compiler can prove dead deletes the whole workload.** The first version
  of `mmapeak` guarded its store with `if (threadIdx.x == 1024)`, which is never true;
  it reported 377,140 T-MAC/s in 0.00 ms. Store unconditionally.
- **Check `cudaGetLastError()` after the launch, not just after the sync.** A launch
  that fails on resources reports 0.00 ms rather than an error.
- **Check `nvidia-smi` compute processes first.** A miner or LLM sharing the card
  silently contaminates every reading.
